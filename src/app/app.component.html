<p>
  Note if you select a particularly large file (>1GB) you will have time to select another file and see that the
  original worker is terminated and a new worker is created for the new file. This is because the main thread uses a
  <code>switchMap</code>
  , but if this behaviour was not desired, simply swapping in a
  <code>mergeMap</code>
  would allow both files to complete hashing.
