# Features

- Simple `fromWorker` function from main thread side
- Fully RxJS interfaces allowing both main thread and worker thread streaming
- Error handling across the thread boundaries is propagated
  - Under the hood `materialize` and `dematerialize` is used as a robust transport of streaming errors
- Automatic handling of worker termination on main thread unsubscription of observable
- Framework agnostic - while the demo uses Angular, the only dependency is rxjs, so React, Vue or plain old JS is
  completely compatible
- Fully compatible with [Webpack worker-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/worker-plugin)
  - Therefore compatible with [Angular webworker bundling](https://angular.io/guide/web-worker) which uses this
- Class interface based worker creation (should be familiar API for Angular developers)
- Unopinionated on stream switching behavior, feel free to use `mergeMap`, `switchMap` or `exhaustMap` in your worker if
  the input stream contains multiple items that generate their own stream of results
- Built in interfaces for handling [`Transferable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Transferable) parts
  of message payloads so large binaries can transferred efficiently without copying - See [Transferable](#transferable)
  section for usage
- Automatic destruction of worker on unsubscription of output stream, this allows for smart cancelling of computation
  using `switchMap` operator, or parallelisation of computation with `mergeMap`
- [Worker Pool strategy](#worker-pool-strategy) - maximise the throughput of units of work by utilising all cores on the host machine

## Usage

### Quickstart

#### Main Thread

ðŸ’¡ Take note! The webworker construction syntax differs for different version of webpack:

#### Webpack < 5 (deprecated)

```ts
// src/readme/hello-legacy-webpack.ts

import { fromWorker } from 'observable-webworker';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

const input$ = of('Hello from main thread');

fromWorker<string, string>(() => new Worker('./hello.worker', { type: 'module' }), input$).subscribe(message => {
  console.log(message); // Outputs 'Hello from webworker'
});

```
#### Webpack 5

```ts
// src/readme/hello.ts#L2-L12

import { fromWorker } from 'observable-webworker';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

const input$ = of('Hello from main thread');

fromWorker<string, string>(
  () => new Worker(new URL('./hello.worker', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' }),
  input$,
).subscribe(message => {
  console.log(message); // Outputs 'Hello from webworker'
});
```

#### Worker Thread

```ts
// src/readme/hello.worker.ts

import { DoWork, runWorker } from 'observable-webworker';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

export class HelloWorker implements DoWork<string, string> {
  public work(input$: Observable<string>): Observable<string> {
    return input$.pipe(
      map(message => {
        console.log(message); // outputs 'Hello from main thread'
        return `Hello from webworker`;
      }),
    );
  }
}

runWorker(HelloWorker);

```

#### Decorator deprecation notice
Future versions of webpack (Webpack 5) minify webworkers overly aggressively, causing
the `@ObservableWorker()` decorator pattern to no longer function. This decorator
has now been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major version of this library.

To migrate from decorators, simply remove the decorator, and invoke the `runWorker`
with your class passed as argument (see example above).

Make sure you **don't forget to remove the decorator** when you add the `runWorker(...)`
function, otherwise the worker will be run twice, each acting on any message sent. 

## Transferable

If either your input or output (or both!) streams are passing large messages to or from the worker, it is highly
recommended to use message types that implement the [Transferable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Transferable)
interface (`ArrayBuffer`, `MessagePort`, `ImageBitmap`).

Bear in mind that when transferring a message to a webworker that the main thread relinquishes ownership of the data.

Recommended reading:

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Transferable
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage

To use `Transferable`s with observable-worker, a slightly more complex interface is provided for both sides of the
main/worker thread.

If the main thread is transferring `Transferable`s _to the worker_, simply add a callback to the `fromWorker` function
call to select which elements of the input stream are transferable.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// src/readme/transferable.main.ts#L7-L11

return fromWorker<ArrayBuffer, string>(
  () => new Worker(new URL('./transferable.worker', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' }),
  input$,
  input => [input],
);
```

If the worker is transferring `Transferable`s _to the main thread_ simply implement `DoTransferableWork`, which will
require you to add an additional method `selectTransferables?(output: O): Transferable[];` which you implement to select
which elements of the output object are `Transferable`.

Both strategies are compatible with each other, so if for example you're computing the hash of a large `ArrayBuffer` in
a worker, you would only need to use add the transferable selector callback in the main thread in order to mark the
`ArrayBuffer` as being transferable in the input. The library will handle the rest, and you can just use `DoWork` in the
worker thread, as the return type `string` is not `Transferable`.

## Worker Pool Strategy

If you have a large amount of work that needs to be done, you can use the `fromWorkerPool` function to automatically 
manage a pool of workers to allow true concurrency of work, distributed evenly across all available cores.

The worker pool strategy has the following features
* Work can be provided as either `Observable`, `Array`, or `Iterable`
* Concurrency is limited to `navigation.hardwareConcurrency - 1` to keep the main core free.
  * This is a configurable option if you know you already have other workers running
* Workers are only created when there is need for them (work is available)
* Workers are terminated when there is no more work, freeing up threads for other processes
  * for `Observable`, work is considered remaining while the observable is not completed
  * for `Array`, work remains while there are items in the array
  * for `Iterable`, work remains while the iterator is not `result.done` 
* Workers are kept running while work remains, preventing unnecessary downloading of the worker script
* Custom observable flattening operator can be passed, allowing for custom behaviour such as correlating the output 
order with input order
  * default operator is `mergeAll()`, which means the output from the webworker(s) is output as soon as available

  
### Example

In this simple example, we have a function that receives an array of files and returns an observable of the MD5 sum
hashes of those files. For simplicity, we're passing the primitives back and forth, however in reality you are likely to 
want to construct your own interface to define the messages being passed to and from the worker.

#### Main Thread

```ts
// src/readme/worker-pool.main.ts

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { fromWorkerPool } from 'observable-webworker';

export function computeHashes(files: File[]): Observable<string> {
  return fromWorkerPool<File, string>(
    () => new Worker(new URL('./worker-pool-hash.worker', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' }),
    files,
  );
}

```

#### Worker Thread

```ts
// src/readme/worker-pool-hash.worker.ts

import * as md5 from 'js-md5';
import { DoWorkUnit, runWorker } from 'observable-webworker';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

export class WorkerPoolHashWorker implements DoWorkUnit<File, string> {
  public workUnit(input: File): Observable<string> {
    return this.readFileAsArrayBuffer(input).pipe(map(arrayBuffer => md5(arrayBuffer)));
  }

  private readFileAsArrayBuffer(blob: Blob): Observable<ArrayBuffer> {
    return new Observable(observer => {
      if (!(blob instanceof Blob)) {
        observer.error(new Error('`blob` must be an instance of File or Blob.'));
        return;
      }

      const reader = new FileReader();

      reader.onerror = err => observer.error(err);
      reader.onload = () => observer.next(reader.result as ArrayBuffer);
      reader.onloadend = () => observer.complete();

      reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

      return () => reader.abort();
    });
  }
}

runWorker(WorkerPoolHashWorker);

```

Note here that the worker class `implements DoWorkUnit<File, string>`. This is different to before where we implemented
`DoWork` which had the slightly more complex signature of inputting an observable and outputting one.

If using the `fromWorkerPool` strategy, you must only implement `DoWorkUnit` as it relies on the completion of the 
returned observable to indicate that the unit of work is finished processing, and the next unit of work can be 
transferred to the worker.

Commonly, a worker that implements `DoWorkUnit` only needs to return a single value, so you may instead return a `Promise`
from the `workUnit` method.

```ts
// src/app/doc/async-work.worker.ts#L7-L14

export class FactorizationWorker implements DoWorkUnit<number, number[]> {
  public async workUnit(input: number): Promise<number[]> {
    return factorize(input);
  }
}

runWorker(FactorizationWorker);

```
